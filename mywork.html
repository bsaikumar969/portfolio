    <h2>Project Background and Personal Journey</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      As a budding UX designer with a keen interest in urban mobility and shared economy solutions, my journey with this Self Drive Car Rental App began with a simple question: How can we make car rentals more affordable, transparent, and fair for everyone?
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      This project grew from observing the struggles of everyday car owners and renters students, young professionals, and urban travelers who faced high commissions, hidden fees, and complicated booking processes on existing platforms. Their needs and frustrations shaped the vision of a commission free self drive rental app, designed to make renting and hosting cars simple, trustworthy, and financially rewarding.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
<p>
      The shift from concept to design was driven by the desire to not only bridge gaps in the market but also to empower car owners. Recognizing that high commissions often discourage owners from listing their cars, the app was envisioned as a platform that values fairness, transparency, and ease of use, giving both owners and renters a seamless experience.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
<p>
      This project reflects my commitment to creating user-centered, socially conscious solutions. Each screen, flow, and interaction embodies my goal of simplifying urban mobility while fostering trust and financial equity. It is a testament to the power of design driven by empathy and real user needs, aiming to transform self-drive car rentals into a simple, affordable, and enjoyable experience for all.

    <h2>Research: Interviews and Surveys</h2>

    <!-- Intro text -->
    <p class="section-intro">
      <br>
      Venturing out to local campuses, coworking spaces, and urban neighborhoods, I sought first-hand insights from car owners and renters themselves. Engaging in face-to-face conversations allowed me to validate our assumptions with direct, qualitative feedback.<br><br>

Using this hands-on approach, I collected critical insights, leveraging these discussions to fine-tune the app’s design and functionality. These personal interactions provided nuanced feedback, integral to crafting a user-centric platform that addressed the real needs of both car owners and renters.<br><br>

Prior to conducting surveys, I carefully formulated questions to explore the pain points and motivations of potential users. The survey reached a diverse group of students, professionals, and car owners, aiming to gauge the relevance and appeal of a commission-free self-drive rental platform. From the renter perspective, there was a clear call for affordable, transparent pricing and a fast, simple booking process, while car owners expressed a strong desire for a commission-free model that would let them earn fairly without losing profits to high platform fees.<br><br>

The feedback highlighted a strong awareness among users of high rental costs and hidden charges, and a unanimous appeal from car owners for a fairer economic model. Despite the existence of other apps, the need for a simple, commission-free mobile platform was evident, signaling a significant market gap. These dual-sided insights served as a compelling indicator of the potential adoption and success of the app, driven by the community’s desire for affordability, simplicity, and fairness.<br>

    <h2 class="left-heading">Meet the Users: User Personas & User Stories</h2>
    <p class="left-text"><br>
     In preparation for wireframing, I immersed myself in the real-world context of potential users by observing activity around college areas, urban neighborhoods, and local car owners who frequently rent or share vehicles. I also explored online discussions and reviews related to self-drive car rental platforms to understand common user behaviors and frustrations.<br><br>

By interacting directly with renters and car owners, I engaged in meaningful conversations that revealed their daily mobility needs, financial concerns, and expectations from rental platforms. These discussions helped surface key pain points such as high commissions, hidden costs, and complex booking flows, as well as a strong desire for simplicity and transparency.<br><br>

The insights gathered were translated into authentic user personas that represented both renters and car owners. These personas played a critical role in shaping task flows and user journeys, ensuring that each step—from searching for a car to completing a booking—reflected real-life usage patterns and mental models.<br><br>

Through this process, I identified recurring behaviors and expectations that became the foundation of the app’s experience. This user-informed approach provided a strong, empathy-driven base for wireframing, allowing the design to prioritize fast booking, clear pricing, and commission-free interactions at every stage.<br>

          Gopi and Rishi, best friends and college students, own a car that they rarely use. They want to rent it out as a side business to earn extra money for living expenses. However, most car rental platforms take high commissions, leaving them with very little profit. They need a commission-free app that allows them to host their car easily and fairly. They feel frustrated and discouraged by the high fees, and they hope for a platform that values their hard-earned car and lets them earn without losing money.

    <h2 class="left-heading">Exploration, Ideation: 1A, Wireframes & Prototyping</h2>
    <p class="left-text"> <br>
      During the exploration and ideation phase for the commission-free self-drive car rental app, my focus was on uncovering the features that would truly meet the needs of both renters and car owners. I immersed myself in understanding how users like Aditya, a student seeking affordable weekend trips, and Ramesh, a self-employed car owner looking to earn extra income, interact with existing rental platforms. The research highlighted the importance of a fast, simple booking flow, transparent pricing without hidden commissions, and a clear, easy-to-use car management dashboard for owners.<br><br>

With these insights, I began translating user needs into preliminary sketches, experimenting with layout, navigation, and interaction patterns. The sketches evolved into initial wireframes that prioritized simplicity and clarity, ensuring that renters could book a car in just a few steps and owners could manage their listings without confusion. Mid-fidelity prototypes followed, incorporating early user feedback to refine the workflows and interaction points. Every iteration focused on reducing friction, enhancing transparency, and creating a stress-free experience for both sides of the platform.
<br><br>
These prototypes ultimately became a blueprint for the app, illustrating a user-centered workflow that made booking, hosting, and managing cars seamless and intuitive. By grounding the design in real user behaviors and pain points, the app ensures that both renters and owners feel confident, informed, and empowered throughout their experience.<br>

    <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      I created an interactive prototype of the commission-free self-drive car rental app and conducted an initial usability test with a small group of potential users, including both renters and car owners. The test was designed to gather insights into the app’s intuitiveness, clarity, and overall user experience.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      For the test, users were given a realistic scenario: a renter needed to book a car quickly for an urgent trip, while an owner needed to manage their car listing efficiently. Participants were asked to complete three tasks. First, they navigated through the app to search for and book a car, allowing me to assess the clarity and simplicity of the booking process. Second, after booking, renters were asked to contact the car owner directly to confirm pickup and communicate any urgency, testing the communication flow within the app. Third, users were asked to leave feedback after completing the rental, evaluating the ease of post-booking interaction.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
<p>
      Engaging users with these practical tasks provided firsthand feedback on usability and highlighted areas for improvement, such as reducing steps in the booking flow, enhancing visibility of car details, and simplifying owner notifications. The insights gained from this testing phase were instrumental in refining the app’s design, ensuring that both renters and car owners could interact with the platform seamlessly, efficiently, and confidently.
    </p>
    
    <br>
    <br>
<p>
      Following the usability testing phase for the commission-free self-drive car rental app, I employed affinity mapping to systematically organize and interpret the user feedback. By grouping similar observations and pain points, I was able to identify recurring issues in the booking process, car management, and communication features. Using Nielsen’s Severity Rating Scale, I prioritized the most critical problems that required immediate attention in the next design iteration, ensuring that the changes would have the greatest impact on user experience.
    </p>

    <br><br>
<p>
      To refine the visual appeal and usability of the app, I also conducted a preference test, surveying users’ reactions to various UI components such as layouts, iconography, and color schemes. These insights were instrumental in evolving the interface, confirming that the chosen design elements resonated with users while supporting a clear, intuitive experience. Through this iterative approach, the app’s workflow, aesthetics, and interaction patterns were continuously enhanced, resulting in a design that was both user-friendly and visually engaging for renters and car owners alike.

    <h2 class="left-heading">Iteration & User Interface Design</h2>
    <p class="left-text"> <br>
      The name of the app for this project, Wheels4U -car rental app, reflects its core mission: empowering both car renters and owners through fair, transparent, and accessible mobility solutions. In the early UI design phase, the focus was on creating an interface that was straightforward, fast, and functional, allowing users to book or host a car with minimal friction.<br><br>

However, insights from user research and usability testing prompted a shift toward a more inclusive and intuitive design, ensuring that users with varying levels of digital literacy could navigate the app effortlessly. The interface was refined not only for clarity and usability but also for visual appeal, combining simple layouts, clear typography, and consistent color schemes to make the experience both functional and engaging.
<br><br>
The app’s design evolution was guided by a balance of strategic planning and user-driven adaptation. The central goal was clear: the platform had to provide seamless access to commission-free rentals, catering to a wide range of users—from tech-savvy students to self-employed car owners—while maintaining simplicity in every interaction.
<br><br>
In its final form, the app’s design transcended basic functionality. It became a dynamic, user-centered space where renters could easily find cars and owners could host vehicles without losing revenue to commissions. The UI fosters transparency, trust, and efficiency, transforming the self-drive rental experience into a stress-free, empowering, and visually satisfying journey for all users..<br>
